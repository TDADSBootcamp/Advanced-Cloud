## Resources

- [Getting Started](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/getting-started.html)
- [AWS COVID-19 Data Lake](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/a-public-data-lake-for-analysis-of-covid-19-data/)

## Getting Started

- find Athena in the console
- set up a query result location in S3
- have a look at the COVID-19 data lake with the group
- have a look at some of the tables, try previewing them.
  - How much data do you scan? Why does it matter?
  - Is this "Big Data"? Why?
  - Is it a Data Lake? Why?
  - Is it a Data Warehouse? Why?
- Warm up your SQL with some queries to explore the dataset

## SQL Deep Dive

We will look at the queries in AWS' blog post related to this data.
Some of these queries do not currently work - we will fix them.
We'll look at the more advanced features of these queries
and demonstrate some ways they can be (arguably) improved using more advanced SQL features.
